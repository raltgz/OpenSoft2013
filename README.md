# ResCite

Citations of a particular article are other articles, books or papers that refer to
that article. A citation acknowledges the relevance of other articles and books in that
topic of discussion. The number of citations of a paper is an indicator of the impact of
the paper. The number of citations of the papers written by an author or published in a
journal is an indicator of the quality of the researcher/journal in research.
Currently, there are many existing software that provide information about the
citations of papers. But the required information is not available in an organised
manner. ResCite overcomes this shortcoming by providing results in an organised
way â€“ sorted by the number of citations or by date, along with providing other
relevant features.

# Features

Given the name of the author/journal, the software gives all corresponding papers
sorted by number of citations or by date. The search can also be done for any user-
given year range. The software displays the h-index, i-index of the author/journal and
statistics like the total number of citations and number of citations per paper. For any
paper, the software also shows the list of citations to the paper.
